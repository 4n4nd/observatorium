title : "Observatorium"
description: |
  Observatorium allows you to run and operate effectively a multi-tenant, easy to operate, scalable open source observability system on Kubernetes. This system will allow you to ingest, store and use common observability signals like metrics, logging and tracing. Observatorium is a "meta project" allows you to manage, integrate and combine multiple well-established existing projects like Thanos, Loki, Tempo/Jaeger, Open Policy Agent etc under a single consistent system with well-defined tenancy APIs and signal correlation capabilities.
  As active maintainers and contributors to the underlying projects, we created a reference configuration, with extra software that connects those open source solutions into one unified and easy to use service. It adds missing gaps between those projects like consistency, multi-tenancy, security and resiliency pieces that are needed for a robust backend.
